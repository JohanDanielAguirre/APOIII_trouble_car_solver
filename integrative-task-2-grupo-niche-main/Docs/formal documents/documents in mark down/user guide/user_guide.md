## Diagnostic Structure Based on Bayesian Network

### Main Diagnostic Categories
1. **Starting Issues**  
   - **Key checks**:  
     - Switch sound.  
     - Battery test.  
     - Physical damage to the switch.  
   - **Potential causes**: Low battery, starter motor failure, loose connections.

2. **Air Conditioning (AC) Problems**  
   - **Key checks**:  
     - Condition of hoses and filters.  
     - Refrigerant level.  
     - Fuse tests.  
   - **Potential causes**: Weak current connection, AC internal mode activated.

3. **Lighting Issues**  
   - **Key checks**:  
     - Light switch connections.  
     - Condition of bulbs and battery.  
     - Light fuses.  
   - **Potential causes**: Blown fuses, weak battery, damaged connectors.

4. **Engine Issues**  
   - **Key checks**:  
     - Fuel level.  
     - Ignition coil and engine hoses condition.  
     - Injector functionality.  
   - **Potential causes**: Faulty ignition coil, blocked hoses.
